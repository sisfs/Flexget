I am really only interested in the FlexGet config portion of this dotfiles fork and have removed a lot of the other files...


## Installation Instructions ##

    git clone git://github.com/sarethan/dotfiles/tree/transVM ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    
### You can set up links to files from here instead of overwriting your .flexget directory before you're prepared. ###

    mv ~/.flexget/config.yml ~/.flexget/old-config.yml
    ln ~/.dotfiles/config.yml ~/.flexget/config.yml 


## Secrets Plugin ##

I'm using the [secrets](http://flexget.com/wiki/Plugins/secrets) plugin to hide my private credentials for various plugins. If you want to do this as well, you will need to create a ``secretfile.yml`` file in the same directory as your ``config.yml``.


## Rar-unpacking

I am still working out some issues with this portion of the config. you may want to return to [Jeff's Fork](https://github.com/jawilson/dotfiles/tree/master/flexget) for this part =)

This entire setup should result in a single video file (``.mkv``, ``.mp4``, etc) in the final destination with a nice name regardless if it's packed in a rar or not.

Here's the gist of how it works:
  1. Flexget accepts the torrent regardless if it's a rar-pack or not
  2. My custom ``content_sort`` plugin ([available in this repository](https://github.com/sisfs/dotfiles/blob/master/flexget/plugins/content_sort.py)) changes the ``move_done`` value if the torrent contains a ``.rar``
  3. The torrent is added to Deluge
  4. Deluge is configured with the [Execute](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Plugins/Execute) plugin to run my ``deluge_torrent_complete`` script ([also available in this repository](https://github.com/sisfs/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/deluge_torrent_complete)) when any torrent is done downloading
  5. ``deluge_torrent_complete`` checks if the torrent is located in the directory we set in step #2, if not it skips to the last step
  6. ``deluge_torrent_complete`` unpacks the first .rar file it finds in the torrent to a 'staging' location
  7. ``deluge_torrent_complete`` calls flexget with a completely separate config, ``sorting.yml`` ([also available in this repository](https://github.com/sisfs/dotfiles/blob/master/flexget/sorting.yml))
  8. The ``sorting.yml`` config checks for files in the 'staging' location from step #6 and renames and moves the files to their appropriate final location
  9. ``deluge_torrent_complete`` tells my [Plex Media Server](https://plex.tv/) to [update the library](http://forums.plex.tv/discussion/comment/372419/#Comment_372419) (scan for new files)
